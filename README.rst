A command line utility that generates CSVs of county-level population data for specified US states.

Data is based on 2019 U.S. census data.

The full documentation is hosted at `Read the Docs <https://get-pop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_

Install
----------

::

    pip install get-pop

Basic usage
--------------

Command line
================

In the command line, enter the getpop command followed by the two letter postal code of one or more states.
 
Eg.:

::

   getpop ny

   >> Initializing getpop
   >> Selected states: ['ny']
   >> Processing: New York
   >> getpop complete
 
Or:

::

   getpop ny nj tx

   >> Initializing getpop
   >> Selected states: ['ny', 'nj', 'tx']
   >> Processing: New Jersey
   >> Processing: New York
   >> Processing: Texas
   >> getpop complete


To get CSVs for all states, enter:

::

    getpop all


CSVs will be saved in the current working directory. See 'advanced usage' to specify a different location to save CSVs.

Programmatic
================

If you prefer, you can also import and call get-pop from within your python app:
  
::

    from get_pop.get_pop import get_pop

    states = ["ny","nj","tx","pa"]
    get_pop(states)


Advanced usage
--------------

Command line
================

Getpop takes one or more two-letter state abbreviations as positional arguments in order to determine which state
CSVs will be generated. Getpop's CLI also takes certain optional arguments that modify its actions.


``--save-dir, --dir``

TEXT. Path of directory where CSV files will be saved. Defaults to saving them in /data in the current
working directory. If the directory you specify doesn't exist, getpop will create it.


``-q, --quiet``

FLAG. Disables stdout during program run


``--help``

Returns a list of getpop's CLI options.


Here's an example that stores the CSVs in a directory in your current working directory called
'your_custom_directory' and clears any existing files in it if they exist.

::

    getpop ny ca tx --save-dir ./your_custom_directory
